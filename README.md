# Car Price Prediction ML App

A **Streamlit web application** that predicts the **price of a used car** based on its features such as brand, year, mileage, engine size, power, and more.  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can be applied to real-world datasets for predictive analytics.

---

## Features

- Interactive UI for entering car details  
- Predicts **resale price** of a used car  
- Converts categorical values (fuel, seller type, transmission, brand, etc.) into numeric form for prediction  
- Trained ML model (`model.pkl`) used for predictions  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend/UI:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (pre-trained regression model)  
- **Serialization:** Pickle
